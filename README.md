Cross mobile application built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 

<h1>Cross Mobile Application</h1>
The purpose of this application is to learn the design and application lifecycle using unconventional methods (HTML technologies, HTML5/CSS/JS). The whole project will include:
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript Functions/Modules</li>
  <li>A UI built using KendoUI</li>
  <li>Utilizing a Backend that is a database (SQL) for the pictures.</li>
  <li>Cordova for the native features</li>
</ul>

Mobile applications are built using their respective platform's language (Android->Java, iOS->Objective-C/Swift, Windows->Visual Studio/C#). When a problem arises that is needing a mobile solution, your first have to decide and plan the workflow. 
That is the grassroots effort to make sure the application is built using the specifications and requirements of the problem at hand. Next is the wireframing. After the design has passed standards, then comes the actual development of the logic and buidling the application. Here is where a lot of time can be spent. Because of the wide variety of mobile platforms available, technically you would need three developers that are proficient in three different languages and maybe 4 because the iOS platform is drifting away from Objective-C and more towards Swift. So you have at minimum three different developers who have to build the same application in three totally different languages, that creates three different headaches. Then there is testing and debugging, which pose a different problem. How do you minimize the development time and efforts?



<h3>â€¦Cross mobile development steps in...</h3> 

Within the last 2-3 years mobile development has seen its fair share of changes and evolution. In the days beginning in 2007 of the first iPhone when having a portable calculator and playing music on the same device, in present time you can now do live video chatting, play an online multiplayer game with friends, access your email on the go, order food and pickup from your favorite restaurant and the opportunities are endless. Mobile applications started as a means of storage using the on board memory of the phone for simple task like calculations and to-do list. When web technologies started to evolve with more dynamic sites using MySQL as a database or PHP to process server code and present sites faster, these started to affect how fast information became available for our devices. Web APIs, Application Programming Interfaces, give you access to information on the web to exchange information between a two points. For example, you are able to utilize the GrubHub API to create a web or mobile application that can be apart of a local chamber of commerce website and help visitors find local restaurants. There are tons of APIs available on the web, both private and public. With cross mobile development you are able to utilize three languages, HTML/CSS/Javascript, to build an application and it can be compiled and deployed for all three major mobile platforms. The beauty of cross development is the extensive availability of Javascript frameworks. Depending on your needs, you are able to use multiple responsive mobile platforms such as JQuery Mobile, KendoUI or AngularJS. If you need a 3D option there is ThreeJS and the possibilities are endless. This can give you an advantage over other developers because you are able to design and create the application using one platform and release for three platforms then beat the competition to market.
